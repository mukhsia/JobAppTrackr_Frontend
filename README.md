# JobAppTrackr_Frontend

React Frontend for JobAppTrackr.
My Capstone Project for DevCodeCamp using starter base code of a _Car Make Model_ frontend with an authentication hook.
The Frontend should be used with the [JobAppTrackr_Backend](https://github.com/mukhsia/JobAppTrackr_Backend).
Uses [FullCalendar](https://github.com/fullcalendar/fullcalendar) for the Calendar component and [React-Bootstrap](https://github.com/react-bootstrap/react-bootstrap) for the forms.

# Setup

1. Run `npm install`
2. Run `npm start`

## Hidden requirements

1. User Password requirement: requires a digit & minimum length is 8
2. User Email requirement: Needs to be unique.

# Stretch Goal/ Potential TODOs

1. Adding Toasts or some notification system to notify the user of success/ failures/ errors.
2. (depends on notification system) Add more error handling, especially for user registration.
3. Refactor to use Material UI in place of React-Bootstrap.
4. Remove irrelevant legacy files/ code related to _Car Make Model_.
